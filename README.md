# Creational pattern

These patterns deal with how and when you create your objects. For each design pattern, we will discuss what it aims to achieve and how Kotlin accommodates those needs.
We will cover the following topics in this chapter: Singleton
Factory Method Abstract Factory Builder Prototype
Mastering these design patterns will allow you to manage your objects better, adapt well to changes, and write code that is easy to maintain.

- Singleton
- Factory Method 
- Abstract Factory 
- Builder
- Prototype

### Singleton

There are a couple of requirements for the Singleton design pattern:
- We should have exactly one instance in our system.
- This instance should be accessible from any part of our system.
