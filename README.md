### Singleton
Singleton â€“ the most popular bachelor in town. Everybody knows him, everybody talks about him, and everybody knows where to look for him.
Even people who don't like using design patterns will know Singleton by name. At one point, it was even proclaimed an anti-pattern, but only because of its wide popularity.
